# Challenge #4, Medium Difficulty: Download Manager

For this first build I'll be putting this into chrome as an extension, since making a completely seperate desktop application wouldn't be different in the field of functionality.
An example of an extension written in JavaScript can be found here: https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted
> This is my first public Javascript build, so if you have time for feedback, please give me as much as you're willing to type.
